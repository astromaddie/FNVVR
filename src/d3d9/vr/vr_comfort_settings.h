  /**
   * \brief Turns off the game's cameras that leave the first person
   *
   * Three cameras of the game move the view away from the head:
   *
   * - The idle camera: after some time without input, the game switches to
   *   third person and turns the camera around the player (auto vanity
   *   mode). The game's own bDisableAutoVanityMode:General INI setting
   *   turns it off and is set here.
   * - The kill camera: when the player kills an actor outside V.A.T.S., the
   *   game may show the kill in slow motion. Its mode (none, player,
   *   cinematic) is read from iKillCamera:GamePlay into the player when the
   *   player is created; the cinematic mode, the default, plays the kill
   *   through V.A.T.S. with third-person cameras. The player's mode is set
   *   to the player camera, the slow motion in first person, through the
   *   game's own PlayerCharacter::SetKillCamModeCallback, which ends a
   *   kill camera already running. The INI value is left alone, so the
   *   game's preference file keeps the user's choice.
   * - The third-person view: the game's POV control, or a save made in
   *   third person, asks for it. While the player plays (no menu, no
   *   V.A.T.S. camera, not dead), the game's own
   *   PlayerCharacter::SetFirstPerson puts the first person back. The
   *   game's temporary third person, used to sit down and get up, is left
   *   alone: the game ends it by itself.
   *
   * The cameras of V.A.T.S. itself are not changed here. See
   * findings/camera.md §7.
   *
   * Only used on the game's main thread.
