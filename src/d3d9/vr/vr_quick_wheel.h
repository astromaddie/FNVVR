  /**
   * \brief The quick wheel of hotkeys, at the right hand
   *
   * See findings/quick-menu.md §6. Holding the wheel's control shows a
   * ring of eight cells where the right hand is, facing the head: the
   * seven hotkeys and, at the top, the ammunition. Moving the hand
   * towards a cell picks it; letting go of the control uses it (the game's
   * hotkey wheel equips, unequips or uses the item; the ammunition cell
   * swaps to the next type held, unless the ammunition is changed on the
   * magazine). Letting go with no cell picked does nothing. Hotkeys are
   * given in the Pip-Boy's inventory with the game's own gamepad wheel.
   *
   * A weapon is drawn when it is chosen: picking the weapon already
   * equipped draws it if it is holstered instead of unequipping it.
   *
   * Only used on the game's main thread, outside of the game's update.
