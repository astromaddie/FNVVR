   * \brief Moves the HUD's meters to where the panel in front of the head shows them
   *
   * The panel in front of the head brings the top right corner towards the
   * centre (vrComputeHeadHudLayout), so both meters are placed there, in a
   * column: the radiation meter in the row of the messages, which are in
   * the top left corner, and the XP meter just below it, so that the two
   * never overlap.
   *
   * The game puts the radiation meter in the top right corner already, a
   * little above the messages. It shows the experience gained and the
   * "LEVEL UP" line in the XPMeter group, in the bottom right corner, in
   * the same rows as the subtitles, which the panel keeps at the bottom.
   * The game window shows no HUD in game, so moving the groups there
   * changes nothing on the screen.
   *
   * Only HUDMainMenu::Create sets the radiation meter's height. The game
   * keeps the XP meter's base height in a trait of its own and sets its
   * height from that base when the HUD's visibility mode changes
   * (HUDMainMenu::UpdateVisibilityState), so both are moved, by the same
   * distance. See findings/hud.md §11-12.
   *
   * The sneak meter ([HIDDEN], [CAUTION], ...), which the game puts at the
   * top of the screen in the middle, where the panel moves the corners
   * to, is placed just below the middle of the screen instead: the panel
   * keeps the lower half where it is, so the meter is seen just below the
   * line of sight. Only HUDMainMenu::Create sets its height. See
   * findings/sneak.md.
   *
   * Only used on the game's main thread.
